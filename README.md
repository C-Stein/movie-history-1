A group project that started by inheriting another group's code. Our group then re-formatted the code to fit a more specific set of requirements.

Using jQuery, requirejs, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Grunt, Sass, Firebase, and lodash. A bower.json file is included to install all bower components at once.
